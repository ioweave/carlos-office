<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, ignore this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action** — including clarifying questions, exploring the codebase, or checking files. If it turns out wrong for the situation, you don't have to use it.

**Before entering plan mode:** if you haven't already brainstormed, invoke the brainstorming skill first.

Then announce "Using [skill] to [purpose]" and follow the skill exactly. If it has a checklist, create a todo per item.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills apply, process skills come first — they set the approach, then implementation skills (frontend-design, etc.) carry it out. Brainstorming and systematic-debugging are Superpowers' most common process skills, but the rule holds for any of them.

- "Let's build X" → superpowers:brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
- "Fix this bug" → superpowers:systematic-debugging first, then domain skills.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Platform Adaptation

If your harness appears here, read its reference section for special instructions:

- Codex: [Codex CLI Tool Mapping](#codex-cli-tool-mapping)
- Pi: [Pi Tool Mapping](#pi-tool-mapping)
- Antigravity: [Antigravity CLI (`agy`) Tool Mapping](#antigravity-cli-agy-tool-mapping)
- Hermes Agent: [Hermes Agent Tool Mapping](#hermes-agent-tool-mapping)
- Gemini CLI: [Gemini CLI Tool Mapping](#gemini-cli-tool-mapping)

## User Instructions

User instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, etc, direct requests) take precedence over skills, which in turn override default behavior. Only skip skill workflows or instructions when your human partner has explicitly told you to.

# Antigravity CLI (`agy`) Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) these resolve to the tools below.

| Action skills request | Antigravity CLI equivalent |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Dispatch a subagent (`Subagent (general-purpose):` template) | `invoke_subagent` with a built-in `TypeName` — `self` for full-capability work, `research` for read-only |
| Task tracking ("create a todo", "mark complete") | a **task artifact** — `write_to_file` with `IsArtifact: true` and `ArtifactType: "task"` (see [Task tracking](#task-tracking)). **Not** `manage_task`, which manages background processes. |

## Task tracking

Antigravity has **no todo tool** (`manage_task` manages background
processes — `list`/`kill`/`status`/`send_input` — it is *not* a checklist). When a
skill says to create a todo list or track tasks, maintain a **task artifact**: a
markdown checklist saved with `write_to_file` (`IsArtifact: true`,
`ArtifactMetadata.ArtifactType: "task"`), edited with `replace_file_content` /
`multi_replace_file_content` as you go.

At the start of any multi-step task, create the task artifact listing every step of
your plan. As you complete each step, edit the artifact to mark it done (`- [x]`).
If the plan changes, update the checklist. Keep it current — it is your source of
truth for what remains; once the conversation gets long, re-read it before starting
each step.

# Codex CLI Tool Mapping

## Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support

Add to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

This enables the multi-agent tools that skills like
`dispatching-parallel-agents` and `subagent-driven-development` use.
Which tools you get depends on the multi-agent version your model
preset selects (current presets run V2; older ones run V1). Trust your
actual tool list over any table — including this one — when they
disagree.

- **Spawning:** give children a clean context with
  `spawn_agent {fork_turns: "none"}`; the default `"all"` copies your
  entire transcript into the child. On Codex 0.145+, role files under
  `~/.codex/agents/` attach to isolated forks via `agent_type`.
  Full-history forks accept `model` and `reasoning_effort` overrides
  (only `agent_type` is refused there) — isolated forks are the SDD
  default for context hygiene, not because overrides require them.
- **Fix rounds:** resume the implementer with `followup_task` — it
  delivers your message, triggers a turn, and transparently reloads a
  child the harness evicted. Never dispatch a fresh implementer on the
  theory that a spawned agent cannot be messaged again; on V2 it
  always can.
- **Lifecycle:** V2 has no `close_agent`. Finished children are
  evicted automatically when slots are needed; leaving them unclosed
  costs nothing. Only V1 sessions have `close_agent` — there, close
  reviewers when their review returns, and close each implementer
  after its task's review passes.
- **Model names:** never copy a model name from a skill, table, or old
  session into `spawn_agent` without checking it against your current
  spawn allowlist — V2 accepts only V2-capable presets and hard-errors
  on the rest.

## Waiting on children

`wait_agent` is an event subscription, not a poll: a long wait wakes
the moment a child produces mailbox activity, with the same latency as
a short one. Short-timeout polling buys nothing and costs a tool call —
and a context rebill — per poll. In measured sessions, roughly
two-thirds of all wait calls were short polls that timed out.

- While you still have local work, do not wait at all. A completed
  child's final answer is pushed into your mailbox and arrives with
  your next turn.
- When you are genuinely idle with children outstanding, wait in
  bounded stretches: `wait_agent` with `timeout_ms` 300000-600000
  (5-10 minutes). After each stretch — wake or timeout — post one
  status line, run `list_agents`, and chase any child that finished
  without reporting. Never stack polls shorter than five minutes; the
  event subscription wakes a bounded stretch just as fast as a short
  one.
- Completion mail cannot wake an idle controller (it is delivered
  without triggering a turn); covering that idle window is
  `wait_agent`'s only job. A stretch that times out with no activity
  is your cue to reconcile, not to shorten the next stretch.

## Model routing on spawns

Every `spawn_agent` you issue — including when you are yourself a
spawned child running a fan-out — sets `model` AND `reasoning_effort`
explicitly, per the Model Selection rules of the skill you are
executing. Setting `model` alone is a trap: the child's effort
silently resets to that model's default, not to yours.

Ask your human partner to add a machine-level backstop to
`~/.codex/config.toml` so any spawn that slips through still routes to
a deliberate tier instead of silently inheriting the session's most
expensive model:

```toml
[agents]
default_subagent_model = "<a mid-tier model from your spawn allowlist>"
default_subagent_reasoning_effort = "medium"
```

## Environment Detection

Skills that create worktrees or finish branches should detect their
environment with read-only git commands before proceeding:

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

- `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` → already in a linked worktree (skip creation)
- `BRANCH` empty → detached HEAD (cannot branch/push/PR from sandbox)

See `using-git-worktrees` Step 0 and `finishing-a-development-branch`
Step 1 for how each skill uses these signals.

## Codex App Finishing

When the sandbox blocks branch/push operations (detached HEAD in an
externally managed worktree), the agent commits all work and informs
the user to use the App's native controls:

- **"Create branch"** — names the branch, then commit/push/PR via App UI
- **"Hand off to local"** — transfers work to the user's local checkout

The agent can still run tests, stage files, and output suggested branch
names, commit messages, and PR descriptions for the user to copy.

# Gemini CLI Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On Gemini CLI these resolve to the tools below.

| Action skills request | Gemini CLI equivalent |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Read a file | `read_file` |
| Read multiple files at once | `read_many_files` |
| Create a new file | `write_file` |
| Edit a file | `replace` |
| Run a shell command | `run_shell_command` |
| Search file contents | `grep_search` |
| Find files by name | `glob` |
| List files and subdirectories | `list_directory` |
| Fetch a URL | `web_fetch` |
| Search the web | `google_web_search` |
| Invoke a skill | `activate_skill` |
| Dispatch a subagent (`Subagent (general-purpose):` template) | `invoke_agent` with `agent_name: "generalist"` (invocable via `@generalist` chat syntax — see [Subagent support](#subagent-support)) |
| Multiple parallel dispatches | Multiple `invoke_agent` calls in the same response |
| Task tracking ("create a todo", "mark complete") | `write_todos` (statuses: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled, blocked) |

## Instructions file

When a skill mentions "your instructions file", on Gemini CLI this is **`GEMINI.md`**. Gemini CLI loads `GEMINI.md` hierarchically: global at `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, project-level files in workspace directories and their ancestors, and sub-directory `GEMINI.md` files when a tool accesses files in those directories.

## Personal skills directory

User-level skills live at **`~/.gemini/skills/`**, with **`~/.agents/skills/`** as a cross-runtime alias (shared with Codex and Copilot CLI). When both directories exist at the same scope, `.agents/skills/` takes precedence. Each skill is a subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` (with `name` and `description` frontmatter).

## Subagent support

Gemini CLI dispatches subagents through the `invoke_agent` tool, which takes `agent_name` and `prompt` parameters. The same dispatch is also surfaced as a chat-syntax shortcut: typing `@generalist <prompt>` is equivalent to calling `invoke_agent` with `agent_name: "generalist"`. Built-in agent names include `generalist`, `cli_help`, `codebase_investigator`, and (with browser tooling enabled) `browser_agent`.

Skills dispatch with `Subagent (general-purpose):` and either reference a prompt-template file (e.g., `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`'s `./implementer-prompt.md`) or supply an inline prompt. On Gemini CLI:

| Skill dispatch form | Gemini CLI equivalent |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| References a `*-prompt.md` template (implementer, task-reviewer, code-reviewer, etc.) | Fill the template, then `invoke_agent` with `agent_name: "generalist"` and the filled prompt |
| References `superpowers:requesting-code-review`'s `./code-reviewer.md` | `invoke_agent` with `agent_name: "generalist"` and the filled review template |
| Inline prompt (no template referenced) | `invoke_agent` with `agent_name: "generalist"` and your inline prompt |

### Prompt filling

Skills provide prompt templates with placeholders like `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}` or `[FULL TEXT of task]`. Fill all placeholders before passing the complete prompt to `invoke_agent`. The prompt template itself contains the agent's role, review criteria, and expected output format — the subagent will follow it.

### Parallel dispatch

Gemini CLI supports parallel subagent dispatch. Issue multiple `invoke_agent` calls in the same response (or multiple `@generalist` invocations in one prompt) to run independent subagent work in parallel. Keep dependent tasks sequential, but do not serialize independent subagent tasks just to preserve a simpler history.

## Additional Gemini CLI tools

These tools are unique to Gemini CLI:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `save_memory` (legacy) | Persist facts across sessions when `experimental.memoryV2 = false` |
| `get_internal_docs` | Look up Gemini CLI's bundled documentation |
| `ask_user` | Pose structured questions to the user (text / single-select / multi-select) |
| `enter_plan_mode` / `exit_plan_mode` | Switch into and out of read-only plan mode |
| `update_topic` | Update the current conversation's topic / strategic-intent metadata |
| `complete_task` | Signal that a Gemini subagent has completed and return its result to the parent agent |
| `tracker_create_task`, `tracker_update_task`, `tracker_get_task`, `tracker_list_tasks`, `tracker_add_dependency`, `tracker_visualize` | Rich task tracker with dependency and visualization support |
| `read_mcp_resource`, `list_mcp_resources` | MCP resource access |

# Hermes Agent Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On Hermes Agent these resolve to the tools below.

## Tools

| Action skills request | Hermes tool |
|---|---|
| Read a file | `read_file` |
| Create a new file | `write_file` |
| Edit a file (targeted patch) | `patch` |
| Run a shell command | `terminal` |
| Search file contents | `search_files` |
| Find files by name | `terminal` with `find` |
| Fetch a URL / read a webpage | `web_extract(urls=[...])` |
| Search the web | `web_search(query=...)` |
| Dispatch a subagent | `delegate_task(goal=..., context=..., toolsets=[...], role="leaf")` |
| Task tracking | `todo` tool |
| Invoke a skill | `skill_view("skill-name")` |

## Instructions file

When a skill mentions "your instructions file," on Hermes Agent this is **`AGENTS.md`** in the project directory, or **`SOUL.md`** globally at `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`.

## Invoking a skill

Hermes Agent has a `skills` toolset with `skill_view` and `skills_list` tools.
To invoke a superpowers skill, use:

```
skill_view("brainstorming")
skill_view("test-driven-development")
```

If `skill_view` cannot find a superpowers skill (it may not appear in the catalog
until the plugin fully registers it), fall back to reading the SKILL.md directly:

```
read_file(path="~/.hermes/plugins/superpowers/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md")
```

This fallback is the same mechanism used by other harnesses without native skill loading.

## Subagent dispatch

Use `delegate_task` to spawn isolated subagents for parallel or sequential workstreams:

```
delegate_task(goal="...", context="...", toolsets=[...], role="leaf")
```

If `delegate_task` is unavailable, do the work inline rather than inventing tool calls.

## Task tracking

Use the `todo` tool for task tracking within a session. For multi-agent task boards, use `hermes kanban` CLI if available. Treat older `TodoWrite` references as the task-tracking action.

---

# Pi Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On Pi these resolve to the tools below.

| Action skills request | Pi equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Dispatch a subagent (`Subagent (general-purpose):` template) | Use an installed subagent tool such as `subagent` from `pi-subagents` if available |
| Task tracking ("create a todo", "mark complete") | Use an installed todo/task tool if available, otherwise track tasks in the plan or `TODO.md` |

## Subagents

Pi core does not ship a standard subagent tool. The `pi-subagents` package is a strong optional companion and provides a `subagent` tool with single-agent, chain, parallel, async, forked-context, and resume/status workflows. If no subagent tool is available, do not fabricate `Task` calls; execute sequentially in the current session or explain that the optional subagent capability is not installed.

## Task lists

Pi core does not ship a standard task-list tool. If a todo/task extension is installed, use its documented tool. Otherwise use Superpowers plan files, checklists in Markdown, or a repo-local `TODO.md` for task tracking. Older Superpowers docs may refer to `TodoWrite`; treat that as the task-tracking action above.
